Transformed client accounting data into user-readable format. Ingested said data into Business Intelligence platform formats for use by various clients, future-proofed to support previous internal data formats and continuously migrate more client data as it is created until clients eventually fully move from desktop into the cloud.  <br/> <br/>

Created python scripts to perform ETL jobs on big data using Pandas and Spark running on AWS Glue Jobs  <br/> <br/>

Transformed csv data from AWS S3 into parquet filetype via python scripts run on AWS Lambda triggered by EventBridge messages. Automatically validated that the files had been converted  <br/> <br/>

Created AWS Athena push notification listener in Spring Boot to avoid long polling for query result sets  <br/> <br/>

Wrote deployment config in Serverless and Terraform. Performed deployments with DevOps team.  <br/> <br/>

Designed and Implemented scheduled data ingestions from S3 through Athena into AWS Quicksight Datasets with automatic validation for successful ingestions. System is extensible to an event-triggered ingestion rather than a scheduled ingestion for streaming files when Quicksight adds partial ingestions
